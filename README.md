# 7D2D-MODS
Mods for the game 7 Days to Die that I've created in order to improve and enhance solo survivor gameplay. 

## Current Mods

### Animal Rebalance
Nerfs hostile animal health significantly, and some animal damage to a lesser extent. 

### Locksmith
Enables lockpicking POI doors. Does not include vault, garage, cellar or shutter doors. 

### Lootable Vending Machines
Converts broken POI vending machines into loot containers with custom loot list. Vending machine may contain cash, dukes, mega crush and/or candy. 

### More Zombies
Disables biome-based ambient spawns. Refactors gamestage hordes to be MUCH larger, and greatly increases the maximum simultaneous entity count.

## Proposed Mods

### Push Shopping Carts
Converts all shopping carts into vehicles, so they can be pushed and used as storage. 

### Drive Over Everything
Fixes vehicle behavior so that they no longer get stuck on blocks. 

### Logical Crafting Overhaul
Make items such as weapon parts craftable. Update crafting recipes to be more logical, such as requiring tires for crafting wheels.

### Logical Cooking Overhaul
Address things like water jars being consumed for recipes, and simple things like boiled meat requiring perks.

### Logical Farming Overhaul
Address issues related to immovable player farm plots and expensive seed crafting.

### Food Spoilage System
Add a mechanic where food degrades over time, increasing the value of hunger and food related perks.

### Skill Balance Overhaul
Fix "must have" perks, improve underpowered perks, consolidate redundant perks, and generally make multiplayer perks more useful to solo players. 
- Intellect Attribute: much too OP. its skills should be spread around
- Sexual Tyrannosaurus: possibly elminate this entirely and instead link stamina cost reductions to the specific tool/weapon skill
- Daring Adventurer: remove entirely?
- Better Barter: either nerf the skill or overhaul prices
- ~Lockpicking~ already addressed by Locksmith mod above
- Animal Tracker: add support for tracking hostile animals and zombies
- The Huntsman: combine with animal tracker, or add anothe benefit such as hostile animals becoming docile in your presence
- Well Insulated: remove entire, or possilby add more resistance types, such as burning/radiation damage
- Charismatic Nature: enable auras to effect the player. rebalance as necessary.

### Book Perk Overhaul
A highly ambitious idea to replace perk books with a perk system similar to [redacted], wherein perks are chosen by the player when they level up, instead of being found at random in mailboxes. 
- Useless perks improved, consolidated, and/or removed entirely
- Perk points granted when the related attribute/skill is increased, or alternatively choose a perk "every X levels" 
- Perks gated behind skill thresholds, similar to crafting recipes
- Perk books instead provide a temporary buff, or possibly collecting X books provides a "bonus" perk point
